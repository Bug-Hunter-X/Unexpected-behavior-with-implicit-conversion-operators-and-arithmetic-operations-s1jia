# Unexpected Behavior with Implicit Conversion Operators and Arithmetic Operations in C#

This code demonstrates an uncommon error that can occur when using implicit conversion operators in C# along with arithmetic operations.  The implicit conversion works correctly when converting an integer to a `MyClass` object and vice-versa; however, when we attempt to perform arithmetic operations directly on `MyClass` objects, the compiler doesn't know how to handle it leading to a compile-time error.

## The Problem

The issue stems from the lack of operator overloading for the `+` operator within the `MyClass`. While implicit conversion allows us to seamlessly transition between `int` and `MyClass`, the absence of the overloaded `+` operator prevents direct arithmetic operations on `MyClass` instances.

## Solution

The solution involves defining the `+` operator overload within the `MyClass` to explicitly define how addition should work with `MyClass` objects. This provides clarity and prevents unexpected errors.
